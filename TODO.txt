- ggplot2
- linear regression where it makes sense/data allows
- change/consider different boundary colors in FIPS codes maps
- more correlations, perhaps looking at vaccination rates
- look into medicare claims, are there any that are outliers/2 standard deviations 
- plotting median household income per county, see if there are correlations? 
  - median age per county? 
- Average Number of Residents per Day ~ quality
- With a Resident and Family Council ~  Overall Rating
- combining graphs, plotting multiple variables against rating
 (to keep the graph readable, I chose the n most correlated variables)
 Complex model vs simple regression comparison in predicting quality
